Visual Clock

Overview

Our Visual Clock leverages the traditional understanding of a clock by using lines around a center point. The line pointing up represents 12 o'clock, the line to the right 3 o'clock, the line pointing down 6 o'clock, and the line to the left 9 o'clock. Unlike regular clocks, our clock does not have hour or minute hands. Instead, it uses visual indicators and light to highlight the current hour and minutes.

Features
Hour Indication:

The line that lights up indicates the current hour.
Colors differentiate between AM and PM:
Blue from 18:00 to 6:00
Green from 6:00 to 18:00
Minute Indication:

Each hour line has five circles that light up to symbolize every ten minutes.
As each ten-minute interval passes, the respective circle lights up.
When an hour passes, the next hour line lights up, and all circles reset.
Accurate Time Reading:

Double-tap the clock to switch to an accurate minute reading mode.
This mode displays three vertical rows of circles:
Left row: Represents minutes (1 to 9 minutes) with 9 circles.
Middle row: Represents each 10-second interval with 5 circles.
Right row: Represents each second with 9 circles.
Circles light up according to the passing time and reset accordingly.
